# General plan

Have a goal tracker that reminds users about goals, and asks them if they're still relevant.

MVP:
- Goal-setting interface
  - Set text-based goals
  - Set due date
- App reminds users on a regular frequency about goals, and asks if they're still relevent
  - Ideally users would not need to have the app open in order to be reminded


Components:
- Goal management page
  - Goal list
    - Lists goals
      - Each Goal:
        - Shows the goal and due date
        - Has delete button
    - Has "add goal" button
- Goal editing page
  - Form for editing goal details
    - Text field for goal
    - Text field for due date
  - Might not even need to be a page, could just happen in the goal list itself
